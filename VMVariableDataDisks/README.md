# Linux VM deployment with a variable number of data disks

This template allows you to deploy a simple Linux VM and specify the number of data disks at deploy time using a parameter.  Note that the number and size of data disks is bound by the VM size, this sample does not attempt to enforce those rules beyond the size used in this sample.
